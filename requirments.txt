1. Functional Requirements
  There must be a minimum of three important functional modules.

  Structure: Your project must have a clear input/output structure and a logical workflow for user interaction.


  CRUD operations, user management, data input and processing, analytics and reporting, machine learning prediction, and simulation are a few examples.

  2. Non-Functional Requirements
  It is necessary to specify and implement at least four (4) of the following non-functional requirements:

  Performance 

  Security 

  Usability 

  Reliability 

  Scalability 

  Sustainability 

  A method for managing mistakes 

  Monitoring or observing 

  Resource efficiency


3. Technology Expectations

  Code Structure: If your project requires coding, you must have at least five to ten useful modules, classes, or files in addition to an appropriate folder structure.

  Top Techniques: You must demonstrate:

  suitable architectural design and modular implementation.


  correctly applying concepts from the subject (data structures, models, algorithms, etc.).

  Validation and error management.


  Version Control: You must use Git.

  Testing (unit tests or validation tests) when necessary
