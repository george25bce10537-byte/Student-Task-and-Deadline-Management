# 📝 Project Overview

 ## 1. Problem Description
 Academic life is chaotic, let's face it.  It is very easy for students to forget what needs to be done because of assignments, lab records, tests, and project deadlines. 

 The majority of project management tools, such as Jira or Trello, are designed for corporate teams and are too complicated for a single student attempting to turn in assignments on time.  Conversely, writing on paper can be easily misplaced.  A **digital middle ground**—a quick, easy-to-use tool created especially to manage the "High/Medium/Low" priority nature of student coursework—is required.

 ## 2.  Project Extent
 A desktop program called "Student Task & Deadline Manager" is designed to help with individual academic planning. 

 A GUI-based interface for managing specific tasks is included in the scope.
 * Use logic to rank tasks according to their importance (priority level) and urgency (dates).
 * Tasks are saved between sessions thanks to local data persistence.
 * **Out of Scope:** * Features for team collaboration (personal use only).
 * Mobile or cloud synchronization

 ## 3. Target Users: * **University & School Students:** who manage several subjects and require a central location to store their "To-Do" list * **Self-Learners:** who are responsible for their own study schedules.

 ## 4. Advanced Features
 This project uses Task CRUD—the ability to create, read, update, and delete academic tasks—to address the issue of missed deadlines.
 * **Priority Logic:** A method for designating tasks as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** priority.
 * Smart Sorting: This algorithmic feature lets the user quickly rearrange their list to see "What is most important" (Sort by Priority) or "What is due tomorrow" (Sort by Date).
 Error-prevention techniques to guarantee that deadlines are entered in a legitimate, standard format are known as input validation.
